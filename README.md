# pulsar-star-prediction

## Dataset info:

Given dataset is divided into two parts: 1. training set 2. testing set.

there are 9 columns of mainly two features and one target variable.Those two features are integrated profile and DM-SNR curve
columns are
1.mean
2.standard deviation
3.excess kurtosis
4.skewness 
of both integrated profile and DM-SNR curve


### 1). INTEGRATED PROFILE

pulsars produce periodic pulsation signals that are too weak to detect.Integrated pulsar signals with respect to its rotational period.This increase signal quality and form integrated pulsar profilepulsars are distinguished by integrated pulse profile as all pulsar's integrated profile have unique shape.So,it works as pulsar's fingerprint

Over the whole electromagnetic spectrum from radio to the very high energy gamma-rays detected by air shower telescopes, pulsars radiate beams giving pulse profiles which are unique signatures differing from pulsar to pulsar. For some individual pulsars,very similar profiles are observed over the whole spectrum. The majority of pulsars are observable only in radio; here the individual pulses are often very variable and it is by averaging the pulse shapes of many, sometimes hundreds, of pulses that the characteristic shape is seen.


### 2). DM-SNR CURVE

 Radio waves emitted from pulsars reach earth after travelling long distances in space which is filled with free electrons. Since radio waves are electromagnetic in nature, they interact with these electrons, this interaction results in slowing down of the wave. The important point is that pulsars emit a wide range of frequencies, and the amount by which the electrons slow down the wave depends on the frequency. Waves with higher frequency are sowed down less as compared to waves higher frequency. i.e. lower frequencies reach the telescope later than higher frequencies. This is called dispersion.
